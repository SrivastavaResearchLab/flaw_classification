# NDT Flaw Flassification

This is the code for the flaw classification problem using CNN and simulation data. Only main Python and helper MATLAB functions are uploaded on GitHub and the training/testing/experiment data from simulations and experiments are stored on Brown University Dataverse with assigned [DOI](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FZGLFB).

**Abaqus_script** contains the abaqus script to generate Abaqus simulation data in an automatic way. See the comments in the script for more information.

**CNN** contains the python codes to create, train, test and validate a CNN. The training is performed using simulation data and then validation is performed using experimental data.

**MATLAB** contains helper functions in MATLAB.
